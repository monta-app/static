# **Monta's Accessibility Statement**

Monta ApS is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for everyone, including people with disabilities. We continuously strive to improve the user experience for all visitors and apply the relevant accessibility standards to ensure equal access to our website, mobile apps, and web platforms.

The European Accessibility Act (EAA) is new legislation that requires digital products and services in the EU to be accessible to people with disabilities by June 2025\. This builds upon existing regulations in the U.S., Canada, and the UK to create harmonized law across all EU countries and has been rolling out since 2019 (EN 301 549). It impacts all makers of mobile apps, websites, self-service terminals, and more, especially when they’re part of essential services like transport, finance, or energy (Monta is in all 3).

## **Our Commitment**

Monta continues to be dedicated to making digital experiences accessible and usable in accordance with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, Level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/). These guidelines help make digital content more accessible for people with a wide range of abilities and preferences, including those using assistive technologies such as screen readers, voice recognition software, or keyboard-only navigation.

We are committed to identifying and addressing accessibility barriers in a timely and effective manner. As part of this commitment, we regularly audit our platforms and incorporate feedback, inclusive design practices, and modern accessibility tools.

## **Accessible Products**

Our driver apps (Monta Charge and white-label apps) and our management web application (Monta Hub) have been overhauled to exceed accessibility requirements. These updates ensure a seamless and inclusive experience for users with diverse needs. We’ve also updated our emails, PDFs, and websites.

You can find the ITI Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT®) report for the following products:

* Monta Charge ([link](#))

* Monta Hub for Consumers ([link](#))

These documents explain how our apps and platforms conform to WCAG 2.2 Level AA standards and how they are designed to be used by everyone. We update them yearly.

## **Accessibility Provisions**

Some of the accessibility features we offer include:

* Super zooming

* Strong color contrast in both light and dark modes

* Correct focus behavior when opening and closing modals or dialogs

* Ability to complete all key tasks using a keyboard (no mouse required)

* Additional context for form controls & global hierarchy changes to support screen reader users

We continue to iterate on and expand these feature sets based on user feedback and best practices. Drivers, website visitors, and users of Monta Hub automatically benefit from these improvements as we roll them out.

## **Ongoing Efforts**

To ensure accessibility, Monta takes the following actions:

* Performs regular accessibility audits of our website and key digital interfaces

* Implements user interface improvements based on WCAG 2.2 Level AA standards

* Tests our content and features using accessibility tools and with assistive technology users

* Trains our teams on accessibility best practices, inclusive design, and universal usability

* Integrates accessibility into our product development lifecycle

## **Third-Party Content**

While we aim to ensure that all content hosted on Monta.com is accessible, there may be third-party components or links that are outside of our control. We encourage third parties to offer accessible content and work with partners who share our commitment to accessibility.

## **Future Improvements**

Accessibility is an ongoing journey, and Monta is committed to continuous improvement. We will continue to invest in tools, training, and practices that make our digital products more inclusive for all users, regardless of ability. We follow accessibility laws and apply guidelines from the EU, UK, Canada, and the USA not only as a legal requirement, because it’s the right thing to do.

Ultimately, it’s about building tech that serves all people, not just the majority.
