**3 Payment for charging your vehicle at our Egg Charge Points**

Unless you select to use contactless payments in accordance with clause 6 below, or you are a business or commercial user with a corporate account as referred to in clause 3.2(d) below, in order to use our Services, you must:

EV Charging Services.

 (b) your payment card has been reported as lost or stolen;
 
 (c) we reasonably consider this is necessary to protect the security of your account;

 (e) you do not pay us any payment owed to us in full by the date it is due; or

3.4 You are entitled to cancel your request to use our EV Charging Services up until you connect your charging cable or your electric vehicle to the Egg Charge Point, after which point you will be required to pay for the electricity used and any other fees incurred as a result of connecting to the Egg Charge Point.

**4 Price**

4.1 The price of the EV Charging Service is calculated based on: 

(a) the amount of electricity consumed (charged on the basis of either kilowatt-hours of electricity consumed and/or the amount of time that your electric vehicle was connected to an Egg Charge Point); and

(b) the location of the Egg Charge Point (including any idle or other fees that may apply). 

4.2 The current prices for using each of our Egg Charge Points can be found in the App and all prices are inclusive of VAT. Prices can change from time to time and will vary dependent on Egg Charge Point. You acknowledge that the final and payable price of the EV Charging Service is directly dependent on use, for example on the amount of consumed energy, and is therefore not always automatically provided before the start of the charging process.

4.3 Unless clearly stated to the contrary in the App in relation to a particular Egg Charge Point, any parking fees due at that Egg Charge Point location are not included in the price of the EV Charging Services and it is your responsibility to ensure that any parking fees payable at that Egg Charge Point location are paid. 

**5 Card Payments via the App**

5.1 When paying for EV Charging Services via the App you can either pay by credit or debit card or by using funds deposited in your Virtual Wallet (which is dealt with in Part 4 of these Terms below).

5.2 Where you pay by credit or debit card, we will process your card details, including those entered into the App solely for the purpose of sharing these details with our third party payment provider.

5.3 Your debit or credit card details are not saved by us and we do not store them in our own database. Your payment details are processed and stored only by certified service providers. The IT platform that we use to provide the Services only saves tokens, which are used for communication between the payment services provider and Egg. All payment information is secured with cryptographic protocols when sent over the internet so the information cannot be read in transit by a third party. Where you are an Account Holder and have registered a card with us, your card details are stored and processed by our third party payment services provider. 

5.4 In order to verify that your credit card or your bank account (for debit cards) has sufficient funds to make payment for the charging session, when you provide and verify your credit or debit card on our App, our third party payment services provider will take a pre-authorisation holding payment on your card or your bank account until the price for your charge has been calculated and your payment has been settled. 

5.5 If a pre-authorisation holding payment cannot be taken for any reason, for example, if the relevant account does not have the funds necessary for the pre-authorisation holding payment, you will not be able to proceed with the purchase of electricity for your electric vehicle at the Egg Charge Point unless you select another payment option. 

5.6 Once your charging session has ended, the pre-authorisation holding payment will be adjusted to reflect the total cost of the purchased electricity. Where your finalised payment for the EV Charging Service is more than the pre-authorisation holding payment, your bank or credit card provider will refund the pre-authorisation holding payment in full and take payment of the finalised payment amount. Where your finalised payment for the EV Charging Service is less than the pre-authorisation holding amount, your bank or credit card provider should release the remainder of the pre-authorisation holding payment promptly following the purchase of electricity, although this could take 2-3 business days. Please contact your bank or credit card provider if you have any questions regarding this.

5.7 All credit/debit card payments are subject to authorisation by your credit/debit card issuer.

**6 Contactless Payments**

6.1 When we refer to a contactless payment, we are referring to a payment made using a debit card, credit card, prepaid card, charge card, smart phone, smart watch or other card or device that is used to transmit contactless payment information to or from a payment account (such as a credit card account, current account, electric money account or digital wallet). 

6.2 Where we offer contactless payments and you decide to use this payment method to pay for the EV Charging Services, you agree that it is your responsibility to check the tariff for the EV Charging Services at the Egg Charge Point before you begin charging your electric vehicle.

6.3 To use a contactless payment card or device, you must touch it on the card reader at the selected Egg Charge Point at the start and end of each time you use our electric vehicle charging service. To pay the correct amount for the charge, you must always touch in and out using the same contactless payment card or device.

6.4 When you touch your contactless payment card on a card reader on the Egg Charge Point, you are giving authorisation for the cost of your use of our EV Charging Services to be charged to your payment account.

6.5 After you have finished charging your electric vehicle you will be charged for using the EV Charging Services. The amount charged to your payment account will be calculated based on the amount of electricity you have used and the applicable tariff for the Egg Charge Point and EV Charging Service you have used.

**7 If there is a problem with our EV Charging Services**

7.1 If you encounter any defects or difficulties in relation to our EV Charging Services or Egg Charge Points you should contact us at the number shown on the Egg Charge Point as soon as possible in order for us to have a reasonable opportunity of examine and repair or fix such defects.

7.2 If you encounter any defects or difficulties in relation to a Roaming Charge Point, you should contact the operator of the Roaming Charge Point using the contact details provided on the Roaming Charge Point.

7.3 If you have any questions about this or our Services generally, please contact us using our Contact Details.

This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors; for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; for breach of your legal rights in relation to the EV Charging Services.

4.2 If we do not provide the Services to you as outlined above you may have the right to ask us to repeat or fix the Services, for a reduction in the price of the Services or for a refund.

**5 Events outside our control**

5.1 If we are unable to meet our obligations under these Terms due to unforeseen circumstances outside of our control such as a failure of an Egg Charge Point (such as being due to failure of electricity being supplied to the Egg Charge Point or any failure caused by third parties we engage to assist in providing the EV Charging Services), we will not be responsible for any losses and costs caused to you. Where such an event affects our ability to provide our EV Charging Services to you, we will restart the EV Charging Services as soon as practicable after the event is over.

5.2 If our provision of the Services or support for the App or the Services is delayed by an event outside our control then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. Provided we do this we will not be liable for delays caused by the event  but if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to end your contract with us and receive a refund for any Services you have paid for but not received.

**6 We may transfer this agreement to someone else.**

6.1 You agree that we may transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms to another organisation. We will always notify you if this happens and we will ensure that the transfer will not affect your rights under these Terms. 

6.2 You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these Terms with our prior written agreement. We may not agree if the proposed transfer affects our rights and obligations under these Terms.

**7 No rights for third parties**

These Terms form a contract between you and us and these Terms do not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 for third parties to enforce any of these Terms.

**8 If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will continue in force.**

Each of the paragraphs of these Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.

**9 Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later.**

If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these Terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date. For example, if you miss a payment and we do not chase you but we continue to provide the products, we can still require you to make the payment at a later date.

**10 Which laws apply to this contract and where you may bring legal proceedings if you are a consumer.**

These Terms are governed by English law and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in the English courts. If you live in Scotland, you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in either the Scottish or the English courts. If you live in Northern Ireland, you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in either the Northern Irish or the English courts.

**11 Which laws apply to this contract and where you may bring legal proceedings if you are a business.**

 If you are a business, any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with a contract between us or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales and the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any such dispute or claim.
