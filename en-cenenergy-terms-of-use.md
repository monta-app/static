These General Terms and Conditions apply to every sale and rental by **CENENERGY** of Charging points, Materials and Services and to all deliveries and all agreements concluded with CENENERGY in that regard. They also apply to all occasional assignments and services relating to Materials and Services.
2. For the purposes of the General Terms and Conditions the following definitions apply:
   * **General Terms and Conditions** – these General Terms and Conditions of CENENERGY covering the sale, rental, operational leasing, CAAS and other services.
   * **CAAS** – *Charging-As-A-Service*, the Service that consists of making Charging Stations available to the Customer and providing the corresponding charging services as described in the Agreement between CENENERGY and the Customer.
   * **Service / Services** – all services that CENENERGY or an appointee of CENENERGY performs for the Customer, including, but not limited to: rental, operational leasing, CAAS and the services mentioned in Article 7 of these General Terms and Conditions of CENENERGY.
   * **DLB / Dynamic Load Balancing** – the technique in which, by means of a dynamic load controller, the power of certain electrical appliances is adjusted and distributed by restoring the energy balance according to the total maximum available power in a building or home and the power demanded by various appliances in order to avoid peak currents and overloads.
   * **IPR** – patent, copyright, trademark, design and design rights and/or other intellectual and industrial property rights, including patentable or non-patentable technical and/or commercial know-how, methods and concepts, whether or not registered trade names and rights in domain names, including pending applications for, and the right to apply for, registration (current, future and conditional, including renewals).
   * **Charging point** – an electric charging infrastructure that allows an electric vehicle to be charged by current that can be switched on and off by the user with a system of personal identification and security. The models offered are smart Charging Stations that are linked to the Platform for detailed monitoring of consumption.
   * **CENENERGY** – CenEnergy NV, a public limited company incorporated under Belgian law with company number 0665.564.807, or its legal successor.
   * **Customer** – the customer of CENENERGY Materials and/or Services.
   * **Material / Materials** – the (parts of) hardware that is/are sold and/or rented and/or installed by or on behalf of CENENERGY, including, but not limited to, the Charging Stations and all material necessary for the connection and commissioning of the Charging Columns.
   * **Agreement / Agreements** – the written agreement(s) between CENENERGY and the Customer regarding the purchase and/or rental and/or operational leasing and/or CAAS and/or other services.
   * **Force Majeure** – any event or circumstance beyond the control of a Party, which occurs without fault or negligence on the part of the Party and which the Party could not reasonably have prevented, resulting in the affected Party being temporarily or permanently impeded in the performance of the Agreement (e.g. riot, war, fire, earthquakes, floods, pandemics, strikes, electricity or mobile-network outages).
3. The Customer acknowledges receipt of and irrevocably accepts these General Terms and Conditions to the exclusion of all others.
4. These General Terms and Conditions apply in full to every quotation, Agreement, delivery of Materials or provision of Services, invoice and, in general, every performance of CENENERGY, unless otherwise agreed in writing.
5. Any deviation is only enforceable vis-à-vis CENENERGY if expressly agreed in writing in advance.
6. The application of any conditions emanating from the Customer is excluded unless CENENERGY expressly agrees in writing.

## Article 2 – Orders
1. An offer issued by CENENERGY is for information only, may always be subject to change, does not constitute a unilateral offer and does not bind CENENERGY. Any prices shown on the CENENERGY website are indicative only and may be withdrawn or changed without prior notice.
2. Acceptance by the Customer of an offer constitutes a unilateral offer from the Customer. CENENERGY is only bound after written acceptance of the order; an invoice or the mere performance of the Service and/or delivery of the Product counts as acceptance. CENENERGY sales staff are not authorised to bind CENENERGY.
3. CENENERGY may refuse an order in whole or in part. If only partially accepted CENENERGY will inform the Customer by registered mail; unless the Customer withdraws the entire order by registered letter within 7 working days, the partial acceptance is deemed accepted.
4. Orders by the Customer are irrevocable.
5. Acceptance is subject to the resolutive condition of normal availability of the relevant Materials on the Belgian market; no compensation is due if the Agreement is dissolved for this reason.
6. The Customer is deemed to have verified that the Materials and/or Services meet its needs. Illustrations, technical characteristics, etc. are approximate.
7. By placing an order the Customer acknowledges being fully informed about and competent to use the Product/Service.
8. CENENERGY is not deemed to be aware of or to have considered the specific application the Customer will make of the Materials/Services and cannot be held liable in that regard.

## Article 3 – Delivery
1. Stated delivery times are indicative and do not constitute an obligation of result.
2. Receipt of Materials and/or Services implies acceptance of the actual delivery period. If the indicative period is exceeded by more than 40 %, the Customer may give notice of default; if delivery then fails within 20 working days the Customer may dissolve the Agreement without compensation.
3. Unless otherwise agreed, delivery occurs:
   * **(i)** upon arrival of the Product within the Customer’s premises (delivery by CENENERGY or its appointee), whether unloaded or not;
   * **(ii)** upon notification of availability for collection at CENENERGY’s warehouses (collection by Customer); or
   * **(iii)** at the time of shipment (FCA – Free Carrier – Incoterms 2020).
4. In case of Force Majeure or any cause beyond its control, CENENERGY may extend the delivery period, suspend performance or dissolve the Agreement without compensation.
5. Separate deliveries/installations are deemed separate transactions even if on the same order form; issues with one Product/Service do not affect payment obligations for others.

## Article 4 – Prices
1. Prices and rates are those in force at the time of the Agreement (or additional order).
2. Prices are net, ex-warehouse, normal packaging included, shipping and special packaging excluded, exclusive of taxes, duties or other charges, all of which are borne by the Customer.
3. CENENERGY may annually revise prices for future products and services according to the formula:

   `p = P [ a × (M / M°) + b × (S / S°) + c ]`  
   where *P* = original price, *S/S°* = Agoria Digital PC 200 wage cost index, *M/M°* = Agoria Copper-wire index, *a* = 0.4, *b* = 0.4, *c* = 0.2.
4. CENENERGY may adjust prices for future products/services (where no Agreement yet exists) in line with availability or essential component price changes.

## Article 5 – Payments and payment terms

   * Interest: **1 % per month** (part of a month counts as a whole).
   * Damages: **15 %** of the unpaid amount (minimum €50).
   * All invoices (even not yet due) become immediately payable.
   * Recovery costs and court costs are reimbursable.
5. After notice of default CENENERGY may suspend further performance, require cash payment or terminate the Agreement.
