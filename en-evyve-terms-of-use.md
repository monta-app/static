    1.  **YOUR AGREEMENT PERIOD**
        1.  By using the Services (including to access and/or use the Website or the App or by starting or attempting to start a Charging Session at a Charge Point using a Payment Card (including Apple Pay/Google Pay), QR code workflow, RFID Card or any other method we make available), you confirm that you acknowledge and agree to and accept the terms and conditions set out in this Agreement. You also agree to comply with and be bound by these terms and conditions in such circumstances. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, you are not permitted to use the Website, App or Services, and you must immediately uninstall the App from your mobile electronic device and refrain from using any Services.
        2.  This Agreement will be deemed to commence upon your acceptance of these terms and conditions, which you do by accessing or using the App, Website or any Services.
        3.  Where you have an Account and/or Subscription Plan, this Agreement continues until terminated in accordance with clause 17 (Ending this Agreement). Where you do not have an Account, this Agreement applies to each use of the Services (including each attempt to start a Charging Session).
        4.  A Charging Session starts only when we authorise the session and the Charge Point begins supplying electricity. A Charging Session ends when electricity supply stops for any reason and the session is recorded as ended in our systems (which may occur automatically or remotely).
        5.  If a Charging Session cannot be started or is not authorised (for example due to Charge Point unavailability, safety reasons, technical issues, or payment authorisation failure), we are not obliged to supply electricity and you will not be charged for electricity for that attempted session, but any pre-authorisation may still be requested and processed in accordance with clause 9 (Payment Options).
        6.  Clauses relating to payment, liability, and general legal terms continue to apply after a Charging Session ends and/or after this Agreement terminates.
    2.  **CHANGES AND UPDATES**
        1.  We may amend this Agreement from time to time. This Agreement was most recently updated in January 2026. Every time you wish to use the Services, please check these terms and conditions to ensure you understand the terms that currently apply at that time of use.

You may not be able to use some aspects of the Services until you download the latest version of the App, you accept the latest version of this Agreement (including by click-wrap in-app) or you accept any new or additional terms related to a specific aspect of the Services. We may also require you to accept updated terms before starting a Charging Session.
        3.  We may change the Services, Charges and Tariffs at any time. Changes to Charges/Tariffs will apply prospectively and the applicable Charges/Tariff will be those displayed at the time you start a Charging Session. For Subscription Plans, we will provide reasonable notice of material changes to the subscription fee or plan benefits, and you may cancel the plan before the change takes effect.
2. SERVICES
    1.  We shall provide you with the following services (the “**Services**"):

Some Charge Points (including some 7–22kW chargers) may only be operable via the App/QR workflow and may not support contactless card payment. Where offered, we may also permit use of third-party Roaming RFID Cards and/or Subscription Plans, each as described in clause 9 (Payment Options)).<br>AND
        1.  Access to customer support services to assist you in using the Services or report a fault, as further described at clause 28  (Contact Us By), subject to this Agreement.

1.  COVERAGE
    1.  We aim to make the Services available to you. However, due to the nature of technology and factors outside our control, we do not guarantee that the Services (or any part of them) will always be available, uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free, or that defects will be corrected.
    2.  You acknowledge and agree that under this Agreement we are not guaranteeing, representing or warranting the working order or suitability of any Charge Point or our Network at any given time, or that the use of the App, RFID Card, Website or any of the Services will be uninterrupted or free from defects. Any charging speed or power shown on a Charge Point or in the App/Website is a maximum capability only and is not guaranteed. Actual charging performance depends on a range of factors (including the vehicle, battery condition, temperature, site power constraints, grid conditions and other technical factors).
    3.  We may suspend, restrict, interrupt or disable all or part of the Services (including interrupting or stopping a Charging Session) where this is necessary due to technical issues, maintenance, updates, safety reasons, compliance with law or instructions from the emergency services, security incidents, suspected misuse/fraud, or to make improvements to the Services. We may do so without notice where reasonably necessary, including where giving notice is impracticable or would compromise safety or security. Where reasonably practicable, we may endeavour to notify you in advance of planned suspensions, but we are not obliged to do so.
    4.  You agree that we may, from time to time, modify, withdraw or remove all or part of the Services, whether temporarily or permanently, without notice to you. This includes adding, removing, relocating or decommissioning Charge Points, changing features, access methods and/or availability of payment methods at any Charge Point.
    5.  If you fail to pay the Charges or fail to provide sufficient information as reasonably requested, we may suspend all or part of the Services with immediate effect until all outstanding amounts have been paid to us. We may also take legal action to recover any monies due and charge you our reasonable and proper costs incurred in doing so.
    6.  Services available to you in the UK may not be available when you are outside the UK, and some Services may depend on third-party systems (including telecoms, payment processing and site access arrangements).
    7.  Subject to clause 18.1 and your statutory rights, you agree that you will not make any claim for compensation or reimbursement arising from any unavailability, interruption, suspension, reduction or stopping of the Services (including any interruption or stopping of a Charging Session), including where caused by technical issues, electricity supply issues, grid failures, telecommunications outages, third-party systems, site access restrictions, safety reasons, maintenance, compliance requirements or events outside our reasonable control.
    8.  If a Charging Session is interrupted or stopped, you remain responsible for Charges incurred up to the time the Charging Session ends (as recorded in our systems) and any applicable fees notified for that session (for example, Overstay Charges where applicable).
2.  PARKING RESTRICTIONS
    1.  It is your responsibility to check whether there are any parking restrictions, access restrictions, opening hours, fees, permits or other conditions applicable at or near each Charge Point and Charging Bay, to ensure you do not contravene any traffic laws and/or regulations or any site owner/host parking terms. We are not responsible for, and we will not reimburse you for, any parking charges, penalties, fines, parking charge notices or other enforcement action issued by site owners/hosts, local authorities or any third party.
    2.  In addition, you must:
        1.  comply with all signs in the Charging Bay and within the vicinity of the Charge Point;
        2.  park within the limits of the Charging Bay;
        3.  not park within a bay designated for a specific purpose when you are not entitled to do so;
        4.  pay all amounts due for your parking at the Charging Bay and within the vicinity of the Charge Point;

        6.  comply with any reasonable instructions given by us or the site owner/host (or their agents) regarding safe use of the Charging Bay and Charge Point.
    3.  You must ensure that as soon as reasonably practicable after a Charging Session ends (or when your vehicle stops drawing power) you remove your vehicle from the Charging Bay so that you do not obstruct access to the Charge Point for other users. Failure to do so may result in you incurring Overstay Charges and/or other fees notified at the location or in the Charges Guide.
    4.  By starting a Charging Session or attempting to use the Charging Services (by any method), you authorise us to charge any Overstay Charges to: (a) the Payment Card used to start that Charging Session; or (b) where you used the App, RFID Card or Account, the Payment Card registered to your Account. Overstay Charges may be charged after the Charging Session ends and may be processed as one or more transactions. Where a session is started using a Roaming RFID Card, Overstay Charges may be billed via the Roaming Provider where supported; otherwise Overstay Charges may not be available and alternative enforcement may apply.
    5.  Overstay Charges may continue to accrue until the vehicle is removed from the Charging Bay (or otherwise stops obstructing access), and you agree that Overstay Charges are payable regardless of the reason you remained in the Charging Bay (including where you are delayed or unable to return promptly).
    6.  We may use Charge Point telemetry and/or other reasonable monitoring methods to determine Charging Session times and whether a Charging Bay is being obstructed. Any personal data processed for these purposes will be handled in accordance with our [Privacy Notice](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r02/___https://evyve.co.uk/privacy-notice/___.YXAxZTpzaGFycGVwcml0Y2hhcmQ6YzpvOmM5ODFmYThiMmZjMzVhOGY5ZDM0N2I3ZWM3MjFhNmMyOjc6M2RiNTo3YThkNWRjYzc1MzViMmIxMTU1ODE1YzlmMzk2Y2RiNTJiOWIyZTJjNjdiYjRlZGI1OTJlNzU1M2MzN2NhNDU5OnA6VDpO).

        10.  you do not do anything that may cause any insurance policy relating to the Network, Charge Point or Charging Bay to become void or voidable or that increases the premium payable in respect of it, and if any act or omission by you results in an increased premium, you must pay us a sum equal to that increase on demand.
    5.  You shall comply with all instructions from us in relation to the delivery of the Services, and the connection and disconnection of your vehicle to and from the Charge Point and you shall reimburse us on demand in respect of all costs, claims, demands, expenses and liabilities which we may suffer or incur arising out of or in connection with your failure to comply with such instructions arising out of or in connection with your failure to comply with such instructions, including reasonable call-out, repair, cleaning and administration costs.

    2.  The Charges payable by you will be made available to you before you start a Charging Session and may be displayed on the Charge Point, App, and/or Website. Charges may vary by Charge Point and location.
    3.  The Charges that apply to a Charging Session are the Charges displayed or otherwise notified for that Charge Point at the time you start the Charging Session. By starting (or attempting to start) a Charging Session, you agree to pay those Charges.
    4.  Charges may include (where applicable and as notified for the relevant Charge Point/location): (i) energy-based Charges (per kWh), (ii) time-based Charges, (iii) a session fee and/or minimum fee, (iv) transaction or processing fees, (v) Overstay Charges, and (vi) subscription fees (where you have a Subscription Plan). Overstay Charges may be incurred and charged after a Charging Session ends in accordance with this Agreement.
    5.  Where Charges are calculated on a kWh unit basis, such units are measured at point of charge by the MID certified meters at the Charge Points (where applicable). Where Charges are time-based (including Overstay Charges), the relevant times will be determined by reference to the times recorded by our systems. Our records will be conclusive evidence of the energy supplied and session times unless there is a manifest error.
    6.  If a Charge Point, meter or communications system malfunctions, we may (acting reasonably) estimate the applicable Charges by reference to available data (including session logs and reasonable assumptions) and/or apply a refund/credit in accordance with clause 15 (Credit/Refunds/Queries).
6.  PAYMENT OPTIONS
    1.  Depending on the Charge Point and location, you may pay Charges in one or more of the following ways (and availability of a payment method is not guaranteed):
        1.  “Pay as you go” – contactless Payment Card at the Charge Point
            1.  You may use your Payment Card via the Charge Point point-of-sale terminal to pay Charges on a pay-as-you-go basis (including using Apple Pay/Google Pay where supported).
            2.  Prior to the Charging Session commencing, we may request a pre-authorisation hold of up to £80 (or such other amount as we notify on the Charge Point/App/Website). If authorised, the Charging Session may commence.
            3.  The final Charges are calculated when the Charging Session ends and we will charge the actual amount due.
        2.  “Pay as you go” – payment via the App (Payment Card)
            1.  You may register a Payment Card via the App and use the App/QR workflow to start/stop a Charging Session.
            2.  Prior to the Charging Session commencing, we may request a pre-authorisation hold of up to £80 (or such other amount as we notify in the App/Website). If authorised, the Charging Session may commence.
            3.  The final Charges are calculated when the Charging Session ends and we will charge the actual amount due.
        3.  “Pay as you go” – payment via the App (App Wallet)
            1.  Where we make an App Wallet available, you may choose to pay Charges using your App Wallet balance. The App Wallet is operated by a third‑party provider and may be topped up (to the maximum balance permitted by that provider) in advance using accepted payment methods in the App.
            2.  Where the App Wallet is used, a pre-authorisation hold may not apply. Charges for a Charging Session will be deducted from your App Wallet balance when incurred.
            3.  You are responsible for ensuring that your App Wallet contains sufficient funds to cover the expected Charges. If it does not, you may be required to top up your balance before the Charging Session can begin or select an alternative payment method. If your App Wallet balance becomes negative, you must immediately top up your App Wallet to clear the outstanding amount. The App Wallet provider may suspend or block your App Wallet if a negative balance is not rectified following written notice.
            4.  Authentication (for example, by entering a security code or completing verification steps) may be required before a Charging Session is authorised. Once authorised, the Charges for that Charging Session will be deducted from your App Wallet balance immediately after the Charging Session ends. You agree to comply with the terms of the App Wallet.
        4.  “RFID Card” – Evyve RFID Card (monthly billing / account billing where applicable)
            1.  Where we make this option available, you may use a Evyve-issued RFID Card to start a Charging Session.
            2.  Charges for Charging Sessions started using a Evyve RFID Card may be billed in arrears and charged to the Payment Card registered to your Account at the end of the relevant billing period (typically monthly), or otherwise as set out in the App/Website/Charges Guide for your Account.
            3.  We may set a Limit and/or require a deposit or part-payment in accordance with clause 13 (Limit, Deposit and Part Payments).
        5.  “Roaming RFID Cards” (third-party cards)
            1.  Where we permit third-party Roaming RFID Cards, you may start a Charging Session using a Roaming RFID Card issued by a third party.
            2.  In that case, you will be billed by your Roaming Provider under your agreement with them. We are not responsible for the Roaming Provider’s pricing, fees, billing, or dispute handling.
        6.  “Subscription Plan” (monthly)
            1.  Where we offer Subscription Plans, the subscription fee is payable in accordance with the plan terms notified at sign-up (typically monthly in advance).
            2.  Charging Sessions taken under a Subscription Plan may be billed in arrears and charged to your registered Payment Card at the end of the relevant billing period, as described in the App/Website/Charges Guide for the plan.
    2.  **Pre-authorisation holds**
        1.  A pre-authorisation is a temporary hold of a specified amount on your Payment Card and is not a charge.
        2.  Pre-authorisation holds may reduce your available balance/credit and may cause bank charges (e.g., overdraft fees). We are not responsible for any bank fees, exchange rates or other card issuer charges.
        3.  Any unused part of a pre-authorisation will be released after the Charging Session ends and the final charge is processed, but we do not control how long your card issuer takes to release the hold.
        4.  We may (where supported) request further authorisations during a Charging Session. If a pre-authorisation is declined or further authorisation cannot be obtained, we may refuse to start the Charging Session or may interrupt/stop the Charging Session, and you remain responsible for Charges incurred up to the time the Charging Session ends (as recorded in our systems).
    3.  **Authority to charge your Payment Card / split transactions**
        1.  By using the Services, you authorise us (and our payment processors) to charge your Payment Card (or the Payment Card registered to your Account) for all Charges incurred under this Agreement, including Overstay Charges and any outstanding amounts.
        2.  We may process Charges as one or more transactions (for example, by charging Overstay Charges separately and/or after a Charging Session ends).
        3.  If we undercharge or fail to collect Charges due to a technical issue, you remain liable for the Charges and you authorise us to collect the outstanding amount from your Payment Card/Account once identified.
    4.  VAT will be included in the Charges where applicable, unless stated otherwise.
    5.  If you owe us any money beyond the due date, we reserve the right to charge you interest. We charge interest daily at the rate of 2% above the base rate determined from time to time by Santander UK plc or, in the absence of them, any other institution of a similar standing. Unless stated otherwise, Charges are due immediately when incurred. Where Charges are billed in arrears (including monthly billing), they are due immediately on billing/charge attempt.
    6.  We reserve the right to retry processing payments where you owe us money for our Services including (without limitation) failed transactions and monthly billed Charges.
    7.  If attempts to process payment are unsuccessful, we reserve the right to suspend your Account and/or access to the Services until all outstanding amounts have been settled and paid. We may contact you by email or post to settle any outstanding balances owed.
    8.  We may charge you reasonable administration costs as a result of you paying late or failing to pay amounts due.
7.  RFID CARDS
    1.  If available, you can request an optional RFID Card (for a fee) from the Website/App after registering your Payment Card and/or creating an Account and following the instructions provided. We may refuse to issue an RFID Card and may set eligibility criteria from time to time.
    2.  We reserve the right to charge a fee for the supply of an RFID Card and for replacement RFID Cards (for example, if lost, stolen or damaged) and/or reasonable administration costs associated with issuing or replacing an RFID Card.
    3.  **Use of RFID Card and billing**
        1.  To start a Charging Session using a Evyve-issued RFID Card, you must tap the RFID Card on the Charge Point reader/touchpad and follow any on-screen instructions. A Charging Session starts and ends as set out in clause 2.1.4.
        2.  Charging Sessions started using a Evyve-issued RFID Card are linked to your Account and Charges will be billed and collected in accordance with clause 9.1.4 (typically billed in arrears and charged to the Payment Card registered to your Account at the end of the relevant billing period).
        3.  If payment cannot be collected (including where your Payment Card is declined), we may stop or prevent Charging Sessions and/or suspend the RFID Card and/or your Account in accordance with this Agreement (including clauses 4 (Coverage), 9 (Payment Options) and 14 (Suspending Our Services)).
    4.  RFID Cards may be linked to and managed through the App and/or your Account, including enabling/disabling the RFID Card, viewing Charging Sessions and Charges, and updating the Payment Card linked to your Account (where supported). You are responsible for keeping your Account details and Payment Card information up to date.
    5.  **Misuse, security and withdrawal**
        1.  The RFID Card is personal to you, must not be sold, transferred, shared or used for any commercial purpose, and must only be used in accordance with this Agreement.
        2.  We reserve the right to prevent the use of, suspend, disable or withdraw your RFID Card at any time without notice if we reasonably suspect misuse, fraud, non-payment, a security risk, or any breach of this Agreement.
        3.  You must take reasonable care of your RFID Card and keep it secure. You remain responsible for all Charges incurred using your RFID Card unless and until you notify us that it has been lost or stolen and we have had a reasonable opportunity to disable it.
    6.  Any RFID Card will automatically expire (and may be disabled) if there have been no Charging Sessions started using it in the preceding 12 months. We may require you to request a replacement RFID Card (and pay any applicable fee) to resume RFID access.
    7.  Unless we expressly state otherwise, the RFID Card remains our property (or the property of our supplier). On request, you must return it to us or securely destroy it.
    8.  Third-party Roaming RFID Cards are governed by clause 9.1.5 and your agreement with the Roaming Provider. For the avoidance of doubt, clause 10 (RFID Cards) applies only to Evyve-issued RFID Cards.
8.  LOSING YOUR PAYMENT CARD, RFID CARD OR APP OR WEBSITE PASSWORD
    1.  Use of the App or Website may require registration, particularly in order to access restricted areas of the App or Website and/or to use certain payment methods.
    2.  We are not obliged to permit anyone to register with the App or Website and we may refuse, terminate or suspend registration to anyone at any time (including for security, compliance, misuse or non-payment reasons).
    3.  You are responsible for ensuring that your password, device(s) and any other Account details are kept secure and confidential. You must:
        1.  not share your login details or permit any other person to access your Account;
        2.  use reasonable steps to keep your device secure (including using a device lock and keeping software up to date); and
        3.  promptly update your Account details (including payment details and contact details) where they change.
    4.  If your App password or Website password, or your Payment Card or RFID Card is lost, stolen, compromised or misused (or you suspect any of those), you must notify us as soon as possible so we can take steps to prevent further use. You should also contact your card issuer where your Payment Card is involved.
    5.  You are responsible for all Charges incurred using your Account, Payment Card and/or RFID Card unless and until:
        1.  you notify us under clause 11.4; and
        2.  we have had a reasonable opportunity to disable access (including disabling the RFID Card and/or securing your Account).
    6.  We may (acting reasonably) suspend or restrict your Account, RFID Card and/or access to the Services if we believe it is necessary to protect you, us, other users, or the security of the Services (including where we suspect unauthorised use, fraud or a security incident). We are not responsible for any losses you suffer as a result of taking such protective steps.
    7.  Whilst we take reasonable measures to help protect the App and Website, we do not guarantee that the App, Website or any information transmitted through them will always be secure or free from unauthorised access, and you acknowledge that transmission of information over the internet is never completely secure.
    8.  Other than personal data (which will be handled in accordance with our [Privacy Notice](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r02/___https://evyve.co.uk/privacy-notice/___.YXAxZTpzaGFycGVwcml0Y2hhcmQ6YzpvOmM5ODFmYThiMmZjMzVhOGY5ZDM0N2I3ZWM3MjFhNmMyOjc6M2RiNTo3YThkNWRjYzc1MzViMmIxMTU1ODE1YzlmMzk2Y2RiNTJiOWIyZTJjNjdiYjRlZGI1OTJlNzU1M2MzN2NhNDU5OnA6VDpO)), any feedback, suggestions or other non-confidential information you provide to us via the App/Website may be used by us (without payment to you) to operate, maintain and improve the Services..
9.  CHANGING, CHARGES AND TERMS
    1.  We may change Charges, introduce new Charges and/or amend Tariffs at any time. The Charges/Tariff that apply to a Charging Session are those displayed or otherwise notified for the relevant Charge Point at the time you start the Charging Session (including in the App/Website, Charges Guide, on the Charge Point and/or on signage at the location). You should check the applicable Charges/Tariff before starting a Charging Session.
    2.  We may not provide notice of changes where:
        1.  Charges/Tariffs vary by location or Charge Point;
        2.  changes are required due to site owner/host requirements, network conditions, grid constraints, payment processor requirements, or other operational reasons; and/or
        3.  changes relate to third-party services or materials you do not regularly use.

For the avoidance of doubt, Charge Point availability, access conditions and parking/overstay arrangements may vary by location and may change without notice.

*   1.  Where you have a Subscription Plan, we will provide reasonable notice of any material changes to the subscription fee or plan benefits. You may cancel the Subscription Plan before a material change takes effect (in accordance with the plan terms and clause 17 (Ending this Agreement)).
    2.  We may change, suspend, withdraw or discontinue the App, RFID Cards, Website and/or Services (in whole or part) at any time. We may also change or introduce new terms to this Agreement from time to time. Please note:
        1.  If changes are clearly in your favour or are not likely to adversely affect you, we may implement them immediately by publishing the updated terms.
        2.  Otherwise, where we consider changes are likely to materially adversely affect Account holders and/or Subscription Plan users, we will provide reasonable notice (for example via the App, Website or email).
        3.  If a change is to your material detriment and you have a right to end this Agreement, this will be in accordance with clause 17.3.2.
    3.  Where the Charges are calculated on a kWh unit basis, such units are measured at point of charge by the MID certified meters at the Charge Points (where applicable). Where Charges are time-based (including Overstay Charges), the relevant times will be determined by reference to the times recorded by our systems.
    4.  Charges may include a transaction/processing fee to cover card processing and payment service fees incurred by us. We may also vary the amount of any pre-authorisation hold (and/or request further authorisations during a session) as described in clause 9 (Payment Options).

1.  LIMIT, DEPOSIT AND PART PAYMENTS
    1.  We may set a monthly limit, being a maximum amount outstanding for payment on your Account (“**Limit**”). We may set, change, reduce, increase or remove your Limit at any time (including during a billing period). We may do so for reasons including (without limitation) payment risk, unusual usage patterns, suspected misuse/fraud, credit assessment, or operational reasons. If you reach or exceed your Limit, we may stop or prevent Charging Sessions and/or suspend your Account and/or RFID Card unless and until you make a payment we request.
    2.  Where you have an Account and/or where Charges are billed in arrears (including for RFID Card billing and/or Subscription Plans), we may (where permitted by law) carry out credit checks and/or fraud prevention checks and may share information with credit reference and fraud prevention agencies as described in clause 21 (Credit Reference and Fraud Prevention Agencies).
    3.  We may require you to pay a deposit:
        1.  at the start of your use of Account-based Services or RFID Card billing;
        2.  if we reasonably consider your payment risk has increased (including where payments fail, chargebacks occur, you exceed your Limit or usage materially increases); and/or
        3.  to remove a block, restriction or suspension from your Account, RFID Card or any Services.

If you do not pay a requested deposit, we may suspend or restrict Services (including preventing Charging Sessions) until the deposit is paid.

*   1.  **Using and refunding deposits**
        1.  We may use any deposit to pay any Charges or other amounts you owe us under this Agreement (including any administration costs or reasonable debt recovery costs where applicable).
        2.  You may request a refund of any deposit at any time, but we may reduce your Limit and/or impose restrictions if you do.
        3.  When this Agreement ends (and/or your Account is closed), we will refund any remaining deposit balance after deducting amounts owed to us. We do not pay interest on deposits.
    2.  If there is a significant increase in usage, if Charges accrue unusually quickly, or if we reasonably consider it necessary to manage payment risk, we may require you to make a part-payment or interim payment (including during a billing period) to continue to use the Services. If you do not make the requested payment, we may stop or prevent Charging Sessions and/or suspend Services.
    3.  Without prejudice to any other rights we have, we may set off any amounts we owe you (including refunds or credits) against any amounts you owe us under this Agreement.

1.  SUSPENDING OUR SERVICES
    1.  We may suspend, restrict, block, disable or limit your use of any of the App, RFID Card, Services, Website and/or any Charge Point functionality (including preventing a Charging Session from starting or interrupting/stopping a Charging Session) if:
        1.  we believe the App, RFID Card, Website or Services are being used in a way which is not permitted under this Agreement, or you have breached (or we reasonably suspect you have breached) this Agreement;
        2.  you fail to pay Charges when due, any payment is declined, a pre-authorisation cannot be obtained, or you otherwise owe us money (including where a payment is reversed or charged back);
        3.  we have asked you for a deposit, part-payment or interim payment under clause 13 (Limit, Deposit and Part Payments) and you have not paid it;
        4.  you go over (or we reasonably believe you are likely to go over) your Limit;
        5.  we reasonably suspect fraud, theft of electricity, misuse, security issues or unauthorised access, or we need to protect the security or integrity of the Services;
        6.  you inform us (or we suspect) that your App/Website login, RFID Card or Payment Card has been lost, stolen, compromised or misused;
        7.  you become bankrupt or make any arrangement with creditors, or go into liquidation, or an administration order is made, or a receiver is appointed over any of your assets;
        8.  you do anything (or allow anything to be done) which we reasonably consider may damage or affect the operation of a Charge Point, the Network or the Services (including creating a safety risk);
        9.  the emergency services or a competent authority instruct us to do so, or we are required to do so by law or regulation; and/or
        10.  we need to do so for maintenance, upgrades, technical reasons, safety reasons, grid/network stability, or because third-party systems or site access arrangements fail or are unavailable.
    2.  We will endeavour to notify you when we suspend or restrict Services, but we may not be able to do so in all circumstances. We may suspend or restrict without notice where: (i) notice is impracticable, (ii) notice would compromise safety or security, or (iii) providing notice would be unlawful.
    3.  When we suspend or restrict your use of the App, RFID Card, Website or Services, this Agreement will continue, and you must still pay all Charges due (including Charges incurred prior to suspension and any Charges that continue to accrue where applicable, such as Overstay Charges where notified).
    4.  Subject to clause 18.1 and your statutory rights, we will not be liable to you for any loss or damage arising from any suspension, restriction, interruption or unavailability of the Services, including where a Charging Session is interrupted or stopped in accordance with this Agreement.
    5.  We may require you to take reasonable steps before reinstating access (including updating payment details, paying outstanding amounts, paying a deposit/part-payment, and/or completing security verification). Reinstatement is at our discretion.
2.  CREDIT/Refunds/Queries
    1.  If, for reasons not attributable to you, a Charge Point fails to supply electricity during a Charging Session and you have been charged for electricity that was not supplied (or otherwise charged incorrectly), you may contact us to request a correction, credit or refund.
    2.  You must contact us within 120 days of the relevant Charging Session (or, where charges are billed in arrears, within 120 days of the date the charges were billed) and provide reasonable information we request to investigate, which may include: the Charge Point identifier/location, date/time, your vehicle registration (if available), the last four digits of the Payment Card used (if applicable), and the amount charged.
    3.  Where we agree a refund or credit is due, we may (at our option and acting reasonably):
        1.  refund the relevant amount to the Payment Card used (or to the Payment Card registered to your Account); and/or
        2.  apply a credit to your Account (including against future charges or the next billing cycle).

Refund/credit processing may take up to 20 days (or longer depending on your card issuer and payment method).

*   1.  For the avoidance of doubt:
        1.  a pre-authorisation hold is not a charge and is handled in accordance with clause 9; we do not “refund” pre-authorisations (your card issuer releases them in line with its processes);
        2.  you are not entitled to a refund for issues caused by you (including using incompatible vehicles/equipment, failure to follow instructions, failing to connect properly, or ending a Charging Session early); and
        3.  Overstay Charges and other location-based fees are payable where properly incurred and notified under this Agreement and will only be refunded where applied in error.
    2.  If you used a third-party Roaming RFID Card, billing and refunds are handled by your Roaming Provider under your agreement with them. You should contact the Roaming Provider for billing queries or refund requests.
    3.  If you raise a chargeback or payment dispute through your card issuer or payment provider, we may suspend or restrict your Account and/or access to Services (in accordance with clause 14) until the dispute is resolved. This does not affect your obligation to pay Charges properly due under this Agreement.

1.  Cooling-off Period
    1.  If you have selected a Subscription Plan and paid the subscription fee when you joined, you may cancel that Subscription Plan within 14 days from the date your subscription started. Where a Subscription Plan renews automatically, you will also have a right to cancel during any statutory renewal cooling-off period.
    2.  If you cancel your Subscription Plan during the cooling-off period:
        1.  where neither you nor anyone authorised by you to use your Account has used any Services under the Subscription Plan, we will refund the subscription fee in full; or
        2.  where Services have been used, we may deduct an amount from the refund which is proportionate to the Services used up to the time of cancellation.
    3.  You may cancel your Subscription Plan through your Account or membership settings in the App or Website (where available) or by contacting customer services using the details set out in clause 28 (Contact Us By).
2.  ENDING THIS AGREEMENT
    1.  **When this Agreement ends (and when it doesn’t)**
        1.  If you have an Account and/or Subscription Plan, this Agreement continues unless ended under this clause 17 (Ending this Agreement).
        2.  If you do not have an Account, there is no ongoing account relationship to terminate: this Agreement applies to each use of the Services (including each attempt to start a Charging Session) and you end your relationship by simply not using the Services.
    2.  **Ending by you (Account and/or Subscription Plan)**
        1.  You may request to close your Account and/or cancel your Subscription Plan at any time by using the App/Website (where available) or by contacting customer services.
        2.  Account closure/cancellation will take effect once we have processed your request and any outstanding amounts have been settled, and in any event we may delay closure where reasonably necessary to: (i) complete billing in arrears (including end-of-month billing), (ii) collect outstanding Charges, or (iii) address suspected fraud/misuse.
        3.  Cancelling a Subscription Plan does not necessarily close your Account (unless you also request Account closure). If you cancel a Subscription Plan, you may continue to use pay-as-you-go options (where available) subject to this Agreement.
    3.  **Your right to end for cause**

You may end this Agreement immediately by giving us written notice if:

*   *   1.  we commit a material breach of this Agreement and fail to remedy that breach within 7 days after you notify us in writing; or
        2.  where you have an Account and/or Subscription Plan, we make a change that is to your material detriment and you notify us of termination within one month of the date we notify you of that change.

For the avoidance of doubt, changes to per-session Charges/Tariffs that apply only prospectively to new Charging Sessions (as described in clause 12 (Changing, Charges and Terms) do not, by themselves, give rise to a right to terminate under clause 17.3, unless they relate to your Subscription Plan fee/benefits.

*   1.  **Ending by us**
        1.  We may end this Agreement by giving you reasonable notice.
        2.  We may end this Agreement immediately (without notice) if:
            1.  you breach this Agreement (including non-payment) and/or we reasonably suspect fraud, misuse, theft of electricity or unauthorised access;
            2.  you do anything which we reasonably consider may damage, interfere with, or create a safety risk for the Network, a Charge Point, a Charging Bay, our staff/contractors or other users;
            3.  you have repeated failed payments, chargebacks or payment reversals;
            4.  we are required to do so by law, regulation or a competent authority; or
            5.  we are permanently unable to provide the Services (in whole or in material part) for reasons beyond our reasonable control.
    2.  **What happens when this Agreement ends**
        1.  You must pay immediately all Charges and other amounts you owe us (including Charges billed in arrear, administration costs, reasonable debt recovery costs, and any Charges incurred prior to termination but processed afterwards, such as Overstay Charges).
        2.  Ending this Agreement does not affect: (i) any Charging Session already started, ended or attempted; or (ii) any rights or remedies accrued prior to termination.
        3.  Any deposit will be handled in accordance with clause 13 (Limit, Deposit and Part Payments) (including set-off against amounts owed).
        4.  Clauses relating to payment, refunds/credit, liability, fraud prevention and general legal terms continue to apply after termination (including clauses 8 (Charges), 9 (Payment Options), 13 (Limit, Deposit and Part Payments), 15 (Credit/Refunds/Queries), 18 (Liability and Exclusions), 21 (Credit Reference and Fraud Prevention Agencies) and 27 (General)).

1.  LIABILITY AND EXCLUSIONS
    1.  Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or exclude our liability for:
        1.  death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors;
        2.  fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or
        3.  any other liability which cannot be limited or excluded by applicable law.
    2.  **No warranties / no service guarantees**
        1.  Subject to clause 18.1 and your statutory rights, the Services (including all Charge Points, the Network, the App and Website) are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis.
        2.  Without prejudice to clauses 3 (Services) and 4 (Coverage), we do not guarantee that any Charge Point or the Network will be available, accessible, operational, uninterrupted, fault-free, secure, or compatible with your vehicle at any given time, or that charging will occur at any particular speed or power. Any charging speed/power shown is a maximum capability only.
        3.  We do not guarantee that any information displayed in the App/Website (including location, status, availability, access hours or pricing) will be accurate, complete or up to date.
    3.  We will not be legally responsible to you for:

    2.  Any dealings you have with third parties are between you and the relevant third party. Third-party terms and privacy notices may apply.
    3.  You agree not to use any third-party materials in a manner that infringes or violates the rights of any other party, and you acknowledge that we are not responsible for your use of third-party materials.

    1.  We may transfer, assign, subcontract or otherwise deal with any of our rights and/or obligations under this Agreement to any person at any time (including to any member of our group) without your consent. This may include transferring responsibility for operation, billing and/or customer support. However, you must not transfer this Agreement (or any of your rights or obligations under it) to anyone else unless we have agreed in writing beforehand. We may refuse such a request in our discretion.
    2.  If you or we fail to enforce our rights under this Agreement, it will not prevent you or us from taking further action.
    3.  A person who is not a party to this Agreement has no right to benefit under or to enforce any term of this Agreement under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, except that our group companies, service providers and site owners/hosts may rely on the exclusions and limitations of liability in this Agreement where they apply to them.

        3.  Notices sent by post will be treated as received 48 hours after posting (or, where sent outside the UK, within such longer period as is reasonable).
        4.  You must keep your contact details up to date. If you want to give us notice, you should do so using the contact details in clause 28 (Contact Us By).

    5.  This Agreement (including referenced terms, conditions and policies) constitutes the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Services. If any provision is found invalid, illegal or unenforceable, it shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable or, if not possible, severed, and the remainder shall remain in full force and effect.
    6.  You agree that this Agreement may be entered into electronically and that electronic acceptance (including via the App/Website and by starting a Charging Session) is legally binding.
    7.  This Agreement is governed by English law.
