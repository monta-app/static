Your privacy is our top priority, which is why we make every effort to secure your personal data.

Detailed information on the technical and organisational measures can be requested from the DPO via dpo@cenenergy.be.

### External

Personal data will not be passed on by us to third parties/processors, unless:

- There are legal obligations.
- For the execution or conclusion of our agreement, it is necessary that we pass on some data to partner companies such as transporters.
- Each of these parties provides the necessary guarantees that your personal data is processed in accordance with the requirements of the Belgian privacy legislation and the European Data Protection Regulation and all implementing decrees.
- For certain processing within the execution of our agreement, such as IT support, we call on other parties. We have concluded a processing agreement with these parties to ensure that your personal data is also processed by them in a secure and confidential manner. The Data Processing Agreement guarantees appropriate technological and organisational protection measures. Your personal data is therefore in good hands with them.

### Third parties/processors who receive personal data from CenEnergy

- The government as in the context of legal investigations.
- Lawyers, bailiffs, government inspectorates and similar third parties in the context of investigations or legal proceedings.

## What are your rights as a data subject?

As a data subject, you have several rights regarding your personal data. These are described below.

| Right | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| The right to information | This right is described in this document |
| The right of access | You can always send CenEnergy a request to view or obtain an expression of all the data stored by us in a readable format. When you request this information, CenEnergy will provide it with all necessary information such as: the processing operations, the retention period, the legal grounds for processing and the recipients. If we have any doubt about the applicant's identity, we may request additional identification at any time. This information will be sent to you within the month. Exception is made for the right of access to camera images: when this right is invoked, we are not obliged to send you a copy, but we would like to invite you to watch a particular fragment together. |
| Right of rectification | You have the right to have any personal data we process about you amended if you know or suspect that it is inaccurate. CenEnergy will update it as soon as possible. |
| Right to object | You have the right to object to any processing of your personal data for which we believe we have a legitimate interest. The processing of relevant personal data will cease, unless we cite compelling legitimate grounds for such processing which outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms or if these personal data are related to the establishment, exercise or substantiation of a legal claim. |
| Right of removal | If you no longer wish CenEnergy to process your personal data, you can request by e-mail to CenEnergy to remove this data from our files/databases. However, this is not an absolute right and you should be aware that other legislation may limit this right. For example, you cannot request deletion of data for which a legal retention period has been established and this retention period has not yet been reached. All personal data that we process about you based on "consent" can be deleted immediately when you withdraw the consent. This can be done on simple request by sending an e-mail to the DPO via dpo@cenenergy.be. However, if there are disputes, e.g. a lawsuit or other discussion that may have legal consequences, our interest in retaining this data is more important than your right to erasure. If such activities are ongoing, we cannot delete data. |
| Right to restriction of processing | If you do not agree with one or more of the processing operations that CenEnergy carries out on your data, you can invoke a restriction on this. This can be done by simply sending an e-mail to the DPO via dpo@cenenergy.be |
| Right to data transfer | If you wish to switch to another employer, you can ask CenEnergy by e-mail to the DPO via dpo@cenenergy.be to provide the data you have provided in a digital format so that you can communicate it to your new employer. This right only applies to personal data processed based on consent or for the performance of a contract |
| The right to withdraw your consent | If you have given permission to process certain personal data, you can withdraw this consent on simple request via dpo@cenenergy.be. |
| The right to file a complaint with the Belgian Authority | If you suspect or think that CenEnergy is handling your personal data carelessly or is not respecting the rights described above, you may file a complaint about it with the competent Belgian Authority at the following address: Data Protection Authority, Complaints Service, Printing Press Street 35, 1000 Brussels. |
