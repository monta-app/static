# bp pulse for Business App Terms & Conditions

## 1. General
These Terms of Use (the "agreement") are entered into between the entity/person using or accessing the services (the "user" or "you") and Chargemaster UK Ltd. ("bp pulse" or "we"), collectively referred to as the "parties" or each a "party". This agreement together with the bp pulse Privacy Statement govern your use of the services operated by bp pulse ("services").

Services may include, but are not limited to, mobile applications and/or websites of bp pulse under its own brand and/or under its partners' brands. These services include all features and functionalities, including but not limited to websites, user portals, mobile applications, content and user interfaces, associated with bp pulse's platform for electric car drivers and business charging stations operated by bp pulse on behalf of your employer or host, where users can manage and find charge points to start and pay for charging processes of electric vehicles.

## 2. Acceptance
By registering for the services and accepting this agreement, you enter into an agreement with bp pulse which allows you to use the services. All transactions that are part of the services, including, but not limited to, initiating charging sessions, are governed by this agreement. Registration without explicit acceptance of this agreement is not possible.

When you make an order for the charging of an electric vehicle through the services, bp pulse acts as an agent on behalf of your employer or host to conclude your order and to manage your experience throughout the order process. If during this process bp pulse has received an amount payable by a user to an employer or host, such payment shall discharge the user of any payment obligation towards the employer or host. bp pulse is not liable and does not take any responsibility for the provision of the charging of electric vehicles by users.

## 3. Prices
All prices are indicated on the services before the start of a charging process or any other transaction is initiated. bp pulse estimates the charging price prior to the initiation of a charge and reserves the necessary amount.

Before the charging process, the price will be clearly displayed as fees per kWh of consumed energy, parking fees for the time of parking at the charging station, and if applicable, charging session starting fees and fees for time of charging. There may also be fees if the user decides to reserve a charging station, and if they do not show up, or overstay. You acknowledge that the final and payable price of the charging service is directly dependent on use, for example on the amount of consumed energy, and is therefore not always automatically provided before the start of the charging process. bp pulse will deliver a receipt of the use of the charging service, including each charging transaction executed.

## 4. Billing
All payment and billing processes described can either be conducted by bp pulse or through an assigned partner company. We may charge you via a variety of payment methods, such as your Wallet, debit/credit card, or by invoice.

Invoices may be sent by bp pulse via mail or email and are also accessible in your bp pulse business app user account. Full payment for invoices issued must be received by bp pulse fifteen (15) days after the issue date of the invoice, unless otherwise stated or agreed. The due date will be stated on the invoice. Unpaid amounts are subject to a charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection and may result in immediate termination of services.

bp pulse may suspend access to the services, with immediate effect, if the user fails to pay any fees invoiced by bp pulse pursuant to this agreement. Suspension will not relieve the user of its obligation to pay such invoices or any other fees payable to bp pulse for the relevant services.

## 5. Obligations
You will cooperate with bp pulse by providing such information and materials as bp pulse may reasonably require in order to supply the services and ensure that such information is complete and accurate in all material respects.

It is your responsibility to ensure that the registered payment method is valid, that it has a sufficient balance and is not blocked. In the event that debiting is not possible, bp pulse reserves the right to temporarily suspend your access to the services or part of it until the overdue balance is fully paid. bp pulse has the right to seek payment from you by other means, such as by sending a separate invoice for your use of the services.

You are responsible for complying with the specific parking restrictions and regulations at the charging station (such as written instructions shown at the charging station or the instructions given by the personnel of the charging station operators). You shall use the charging station correctly and in accordance with the provided instructions and ensure that the charging station is suitable for the vehicle to be charged. If the charging station is damaged or defective, the user should inform bp pulse.

You must take due care to protect your bp pulse business app account against misuse by others and promptly notify bp pulse about any detected misuse. You are responsible for keeping your account secure and not granting access to your account to others. You are obligated to immediately notify bp pulse if you believe that your account or the charging key has been used by an unauthorized person or in an unauthorized manner. bp pulse may then block your access to the services.

In the event of the loss of your charging key or the mobile phone on which the bp pulse business app has been installed, you shall immediately notify bp pulse. We may then block your access to the services. If you do not give such notification and the charging key or the mobile phone in question remains in illegitimate use, bp pulse reserves the right to claim incurred losses as damage from you in accordance with applicable law. For the sake of clarity, this clause does not constitute additional claims for damages against you as a consumer.

You are solely responsible for ensuring that you comply with all applicable regulations, laws, or conventions before using the services.

Unless explicitly granted to you in writing by bp pulse, you must not (and must not allow any third party to) directly or indirectly:
I. Rent, lease, copy, transfer, resell, sublicense, lease, time-share, or otherwise provide access to the services to a third party;
II. Modify or create a derivative work of the bp pulse services or any portion of it;
III. Reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs to the services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law and then only with advance notice in writing to bp pulse;
IV. Break or circumvent any security measures of the services or configure the services to avoid incurring fees or in any way disrupt the integrity, performance or security of the services;
V. Access the services for the purpose of building a competitive product or service or copying its features or user interfaces;
VI. Use or permit the services to be used for any illegal or misleading purpose, or any manner inconsistent with this agreement;
VII. Collect, use, and disclose data that violates any third-party rights, including privacy, publicity rights and intellectual property rights.

("Intellectual Property Rights" meaning all intellectual property rights globally, whether registrable or unregistrable, registered or unregistered, including any application or right of application for such rights (including but not limited to any and all copyright and related rights, database rights, confidential information, trade secrets, know-how, business names, trade names, trademarks, service marks, passing off rights, unfair competition rights, patents, petty patents, utility models, semiconductor topography rights and rights in designs).

You agree that bp pulse retains all rights, title and interest (including all Intellectual Property Rights) in and to the services, and all related or underlying documentation, technology, code, know-how, logos, templates, anything delivered as part of the support of other services, and any updates, modifications, or derivative works of any of the foregoing (all of which is deemed bp pulse’s confidential information) and that bp pulse reserves any licenses not specifically granted in this agreement. You acknowledge and agree that you have no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any of the services and that bp pulse or their assigned partner provider has sole discretion to make updates, bug fixes, modifications or improvements to the services from time to time. bp pulse reserves the right to change or remove features of the services from time to time.

We continuously work for a more sustainable and developed grid. This implies that bp pulse may temporarily pause an ongoing charge, thereby contributing to the stability of the electricity grid. The temporary pause will not have a noticeable effect on the total charge of your electric vehicle. You can at any time opt out of participating by toggling off PowerBank in the app or the portal, as far as you are provided this feature in your bp pulse business app.

## 6. Liability
The use of the services is the sole responsibility of the user. The services are supplied "as is" and may be modified, updated, interrupted, suspended or discontinued at any time without notice or liability. All warranties, conditions and other terms implied by statute or law are, to the fullest extent permitted by law, excluded from the agreement.

Nothing in this agreement shall operate so as to exclude or limit either party's liability to the other for death or personal physical injury arising out of negligence, fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation. bp pulse (or its affiliates, licensors and suppliers) shall not be liable concerning any subject matter arising from or related to this agreement, the services or any of the websites of bp pulse or regardless of the form of any claim or action (whether in contract, negligence, strict liability or otherwise) for: 
(i) any loss of profits, contracts, revenue, business, business opportunity, loss or corruption of data or recovery of data, goodwill, security breach resulting from a failure of a third party telecommunications and/or the internet, anticipated savings or revenue (regardless of whether any of these is direct, indirect or consequential); 
(ii) any loss or damage arising in connection with liabilities to third parties (whether direct, indirect or consequential); 
(iii) any matter beyond its reasonable control; 
(iv) any indirect, incidental or consequential loss or damage whatsoever; or 
(v) damages in the aggregate for all claims in excess of amounts paid to bp pulse by the user during the 12-month period preceding the date on which the first claim arose, even if bp pulse has been advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations are independent from all other provisions of this agreement and shall apply notwithstanding the failure of any remedy provided herein.

## 7. Force Majeure
Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligation under this agreement (except payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act.

## 8. Termination
This agreement may be terminated by either party without notice at any time for any reason. After termination, you will no longer have access to the services. All sections of this agreement which by their nature should survive termination will survive termination, including, without limitation, accrued rights to payment, confidentiality obligations, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability. Thus, the termination does not affect existing claims with respect to the charging processes that have previously taken place, including the obligation to pay for all charging sessions you initiated before the termination.

## 9. Data Protection
bp pulse or commissioned service providers collect, process and use data pertaining to you for the implementation of the contractual relationship pursuant to the provisions of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation (EU/2016/679), and other applicable data protection legislation.

Unique identification numbers that are used to identify you, your vehicle, personal details and transactional details may be transferred to the operator of the charging station for the purpose of activating the charging stations, solving potential issues regarding the charging service and invoicing. Personal details, contact details and transactional details may also be transferred to the partners of bp pulse for the purpose of conducting payment transactions, invoicing and customer service.

bp pulse may use non-personal data collected in the provision of the services in order to (i) improve the services and its other products and services, and (ii) share statistical information with its partners. For further information, please see our bp pulse Privacy Statement.

## 10. Third Party Terms
bp pulse may use third party applications, services and software in order to support your use of the services, but not limited to, payment services, identity management services, location and map services software, market analytics software, market intelligence software, and rewards software, all of which may gather and report information about you in connection with your use of bp pulse’s websites and/or mobile applications (such as location information, device information, and user content and behavior). When you use bp pulse’s websites and/or mobile applications you are agreeing to bp pulse’s use of such third-party software and services.

In some circumstances, we may use third party debt collection agencies to recover any sums due to us. By using bp pulse’s websites and/or mobile applications, you are agreeing to bp pulse’s use of third-party debt collection agencies and the sharing of necessary billing and payment-related information for that purpose, subject to the terms of our Privacy Statement.

## 11. Changes to Websites and Mobile Applications
bp pulse may change the format, content and/or functionality of all or any part of the website and/or mobile applications at any time. If bp pulse needs to undertake any maintenance activity you may not be able to use all or part of the website and mobile applications whilst bp pulse completes this activity but bp pulse will seek to minimize any time the website and mobile applications are unavailable for use.

Updates to the mobile applications may be issued from time to time. Depending on the update, you may not be able to use all or part of the mobile applications until you have downloaded the latest version of the mobile applications and accepted any new terms or downloaded and updated your phone’s software or operating system. If your phone is unable to update to the operating system required for any new version of the mobile applications, you may no longer be able to use the mobile applications.

## 12. Waiver
bp pulse's decision not to enforce or exercise any provision of the agreement is not a waiver of that provision.

## 13. Assignment
The user is not entitled to transfer any rights or obligations under the agreement to any third party without the prior written consent from bp pulse.

## 14. Severability
Should any provision of the agreement be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the agreement, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.

## 15. Using Charging Stations
bp pulse does not guarantee the performance nor continuous availability of charging points at business charging stations operated by bp pulse on behalf of your employer or host. Although problems are rare, from time to time they do happen. Service from charging points can be interrupted for a number of reasons including cellular telecommunications issues, grid connection and other electrical issues as well as other matters that are not within bp pulse’s control. bp pulse tries to resolve issues as soon as possible after becoming aware of them.

Whilst bp pulse strives to provide the most accurate information possible through the websites and mobile applications, it cannot guarantee the accuracy of the information provided as it can be affected by telecommunications issues, grid faults or other matters that are not within bp pulse’s control. You agree that you will use all charging points safely and with reasonable care and skill.

## 16. Wallet
All payment and billing processes described can either be conducted by bp pulse or through an assigned partner company. The Wallet is a virtual payment method which can be used to pay for charging your EV by funds placed in your personal bp pulse business app account directly by use of the app or by use of a charge key connected to your account (“Wallet”). The Wallet can be loaded by a user by means of credit card or other accepted payment methods. The user may credit money to their Wallet either manually or automatically when the balance goes below a certain amount. The user may also withdraw their balance from their Wallet. bp pulse does not charge fees for the credit or withdrawal process.

The Wallet will also be used to settle expenses occurring through vehicle charging at home, i.e. “home reimbursement” (conditions with your employer apply). A user who scans a QR code at their employer’s or host’s charging station and is not an existing bp pulse business app user (“guest user”) may also make use of the Wallet, subject to providing the required user information and acceptance of the Terms of Use.

If the Wallet has insufficient funds for the estimated price of the charge, the user will be asked to ensure sufficient balance is on the Wallet prior to authorization or to choose an alternative payment method. Before accepting to initiate the charge in the bp pulse business app, you will be asked to enter your personal security 4-digit code. For guest users, the authorization is made by verification by e-mail or phone. Once a charge is authorized by use of the Wallet, the amount corresponding to the charge price is charged from the Wallet immediately after the charging session.

You may not place funds in the Wallet in excess of £210. Each transfer to top up your Wallet is capped at £110. A deposit request in excess of this amount will be rejected. Funds on your Wallet may be used only to pay for charging services or products in the bp pulse business app facilitating your charging. In the event of a negative balance in the Wallet, the user is required to immediately deposit funds to settle the balance. A Wallet may be blocked by bp pulse in the event of a negative balance which has not been re-filled after a written notice. You are required to use or withdraw funds placed in your Wallet within 5 years from the top-up date. bp pulse will send a reminder prior to the expiration date. Funds that are unused after the 5-year period will be lost.

The user shall regularly make oversight of the transactions to make sure they correspond to their actual charging. The user shall notify bp pulse as soon as possible in the event of any incorrect registrations. If you become aware of any misuse, or if you lose your charge key, you are required to deregister the charge key in your account, and to contact bp pulse business support so we can block the account and avoid any misuse. The user is liable for any payments made by use of the Wallet. In the event of misuse by a third party or unauthorized use of the Wallet, bp pulse shall cover the loss a user may have suffered, provided the user has not acted fraudulent, has adhered to these terms, and as soon as possible after the incident has informed bp pulse hereof. 

Any objections on a transaction due to an unauthorized or incorrect transaction shall be notified to bp pulse as soon as possible after the disputed transaction. When assessing whether objections have been notified as soon as possible, the requirement to regularly make oversight of transactions will be considered.

It is of great importance to bp pulse that our users are comfortable using our payment options, including the Wallet. Any personal information used for a purchase or use of the Wallet is processed responsibly and in compliance with applicable payment and data protection laws. Please refer to bp pulse Privacy Statement for more information.

**Credits:** Credits received in your Wallet from referrals, promotion codes or by participation in PowerBank (if applicable), may only be used for charging in the bp pulse app and cannot be withdrawn. Referrals and promo codes may only be shared with individuals who are not existing bp pulse business app users. Any violation hereof will result in such credits being annulled. Unused Credits are automatically and without notice removed from your account 6 months from the date they were received.

## 17. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
This agreement is subject to the laws of England and Wales. If any dispute arising out of or in connection with this agreement were to be litigated, such dispute shall be settled by the English courts or any other courts in the United Kingdom.

## 18. Changes to these Terms of Use
This agreement was last updated on 1 April 2025. bp pulse reserves the right in its sole discretion to modify, update, or otherwise revise the Terms of Use at any time. Such revisions shall be effective immediately upon posting updates to the Terms of Use on this webpage. bp pulse will notify you of any material changes to the terms. By using the services after bp pulse has posted any modification, updates, or revisions, the user agrees to be bound by such revised Terms of Use. If any modification, update, or other change to these Terms of Use are not acceptable to you, then you have the right to terminate this agreement provided you immediately terminate your use or access to the services.
