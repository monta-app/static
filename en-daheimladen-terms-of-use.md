Company Registration Number: HRB 739413, Registergericht: Amtsgericht Mannheim,
 
1. General
 

These Terms of Use (the “Agreement”) are entered into between the entity/person using or accessing the Services (the “User” or “You”) and New Inergy GmbH (“New Inergy” or “we”), collectively referred to as the “Parties” or each a “Party”.
 
This Agreement together with the New Inergy GmbH Privacy Policy governs your use of the services operated by New Inergy (“Services”). These Services may include mobile applications and/or websites operated by New Inergy under its own brand or under its partners’ brands. The Services include features such as user portals, content, and user interfaces, associated with Click2Charge, our platform for electric vehicle drivers and charge point operators, where users can manage and find charge points to start and pay for charging electric vehicles.


2. Acceptance
 

By registering for the Services and accepting this Agreement, you enter into an agreement with New Inergythat allows you to use the Services. All transactions related to the Services, including but not limited to initiating charging sessions are governed by this agreement. Registration without explicit acceptance of this Agreement is not possible.
 
When you make an order for the charging of an electric vehicle through the Services, whether at a public charge point (public charging) or a private charger (private charging) New Inergy acts as a facilitator to manage your charging experience on behalf of the Operator or the private wallbox owner, including overseeing the process and any related transactions.
 
If during the process of public charging New Inergy receives a payment on behalf of an Operator, such payment discharges your obligation towards the Operator. When you make an order to charge an electric vehicle at a charge point not integrated into the New Inergy platform, New Inergy acts as an e-mobility provider (EMP), and the sale of electricity is concluded directly between you and New Inergy.


3. Prices 
 

Click2Charge is free for personal use and enterprises with charging stations branded as DaheimLader or Injet purchased from New Inergy, but may charge for certain Services, such as transaction fees for facilitating the sharing of charge points with other users.
 
For enterprises, businesses, and other partners with charging stations that are not branded as DaheimLader or Injet, Services may be subject to monthly subscription plans and usage fees as agreed. 
 
Premium services will also apply to charging stations branded as DaheimLader or Injet (e.g., public charging, integration into roaming networks, sponsored charging for employees, or managing more than three EV charging stations). These services may be subject to monthly subscription plans and usage fees as agreed upon.
 
For consumers, all applicable prices are listed inclusive of VAT. For businesses, applicable prices are exclusive of VAT unless otherwise stated. All prices are indicated on the Services before a charging process or any other transaction is initiated. New Inergy estimates the charging price before the start of a charge and reserves the necessary amount.
 
Before a public charging process is initiated, prices will be displayed as fees per kWh of consumed energy, parking fees for time of parking at the charging station, and if applicable, session starting fees and time-of-charging fees. There may also be reservation fees if the User reserves a charging station but does not show up or overstays. The final price of the charging service depends on actual usage, such as the amount of energy consumed.
 
New Inergy will issue a receipt for each charging transaction.


4. Billing
 

New Inergy may charge you using various payment methods, such as your Wallet, debit/credit card, or by invoice.
 
Invoices may be sent by New Inergy via mail or email and are also accessible in your user account. Full payment for invoices must be received by New Inergy within fifteen (15) days of the issue date, unless otherwise stated or agreed. The due date will be clearly indicated on the invoice. Unpaid amounts may incur a charge of 1.5% per month on the outstanding balance or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection, and may result in the immediate suspension of the Services.
 
New Inergy may suspend access to the Services with immediate effect if the User fails to pay any fees invoiced. Suspension does not relieve the User from the obligation to pay any outstanding amounts.
