## 7. Your Data Protection Rights
Under certain circumstances (and subject to exemptions) you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal information. If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out below, please [contact us](https://www.bppulse.co.uk/help-centre#1jfL3MidUvUMlN9SKyAGgs). You have the right to: 
* Request access to your personal information.  Where applicable, you are entitled to receive a copy of personal information we hold about you. 
* Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. You may request that we correct any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please ~contact us~ to update us in the event of any changes to your personal information. 
* Request erasure of your personal information. You may request that we delete or remove personal information where there is no overriding reason for us to continue to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with applicable law. 
* Object to processing of your personal information. Where we are relying on legitimate interests, you have the right to object to processing of your personal data where you consider that the processing impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue to process your personal information and if this is the case, we will inform you. 
* Request restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios: 
* If you want us to establish the data's accuracy; 
* Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; 
* Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; and/or 
* You have objected to our use of your personal information but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to continue to process it. 
* Request the transfer of certain of your personal information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Please note that this right only applies to information you provided to us and which we process on the basis of consent or where it is necessary to perform a contract with you. 
* Withdraw consent where we are relying on consent to process your personal information. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. 
* Complain to the data protection regulatory authority. You have the right to complain to the relevant  data protection supervisory authority (regulator) at any time. If possible, we would appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the relevant data protection regulator, so please contact us in the first instance. Additionally, certain regulators encourage you to contact us as the data controller in the first instance, please refer to any guidance produced by the relevant regulator in this regard.  If you are located in the EEA/Switzerland/UK, see below for more information about identifying the relevant regulator. 

## 8. Retention period, or alternatively, the criteria used to determine that period
How long we will hold your personal information for will vary and will be determined by the purpose for which we are using it. We will need to keep the data for as long as is necessary for that purpose in line with our business needs, [as documented in our Global Records Retention Schedule]. These may vary between jurisdictions.  [For example, if you are located in the UK and we have a contract with you, we will typically retain your personal information for a period of 6 years following termination of that contract, unless litigation is anticipated when we will keep it longer.] Additionally, there may be laws or regulation which set a minimum period for which we have to keep your personal information. We will only hold your information for the defined retention period, before anonymizing the information or deleting it. Anonymising the personal information means making it so that it can no longer be identifiable to you personally. This can be achieved either by aggregating the data (for example, to make a finding about a group of people as opposed to a specific individual) or by removing any personal identifiers (for example, contact information) so that it can still be used to identify trends and patterns but cannot be linked back to a specific individual. 
If you would like further information in connection with the retention period that is applicable to your personal information held for a specific purpose, please [contact us](https://www.bppulse.co.uk/help-centre#1jfL3MidUvUMlN9SKyAGgs). 
For retention periods relating to cookie data specifically, please refer to our Cookies statement. 
If you choose to unsubscribe from a service, we may keep a ‘suppression list’ containing your details so we know you have unsubscribed and to ensure you are not contacted again. Your personal information held on a suppression list will not be used for any other purpose.

This Digital Asset may contain links to Digital Assets or content provided by other third parties which are outside our control and are not covered by our privacy statement. Interacting with that content may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We encourage you to read those providers’ own privacy statements.
