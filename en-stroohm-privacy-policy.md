## Personal data that we process
stroohm.be processes your personal data because you use our services and/or because you provide them to us yourself. This data can be transferred directly to Stroohm.be or made available to one of our partners under their platform. In the case of the latter situation, we refer to the privacy policy on [https://stroohm.evc-net.com/](https://stroohm.evc-net.com/)

## Special and/or sensitive personal data that we process
Our website and/or service does not intend to collect data about website visitors who are younger than 16 years of age, unless they have permission from their parents or guardian. However, we cannot check whether a visitor is older than 16. We therefore advise parents to be involved in the online activities of their children, in order to prevent data about children being collected without parental consent. If you are convinced that we have collected personal data about a minor without this consent, please contact us via info@stroohm.be, and we will delete this information.

## For what purpose and on what basis do we process personal data?
stroohm.be processes your personal data for the following purposes (in accordance with article 6 and article 13, 1, c GDPR):

- To process your payment
- To be able to call or email you if this is necessary to carry out our services
- To deliver goods and services to you

stroohm.be also processes personal data if we are legally obliged to do so, such as data that we need for our tax return.

## Automated decision-making
stroohm.be does not make decisions based on automated processing on matters that can have (significant) consequences for people. This concerns decisions that are made by computer programs or systems, without a human being (for example an employee of stroohm.be) involved.

## How long we store personal data
stroohm.be does not store your personal data for longer than is strictly necessary to achieve the purposes for which your data is collected. We use the following retention periods for the following (categories) of personal data:

## Sharing personal data with third parties
stroohm.be does not sell your data to third parties and only provides it if this is necessary for the execution of our agreement with you or to comply with a legal obligation. We conclude a processing agreement with companies that process your data on our behalf to ensure the same level of security and confidentiality of your data. stroohm.be remains responsible for these processes.
