## 3. **Why we collect your personal information and what we do with it**

We collect and use your personal data if one of the following legal reasons applies:

-  For the performance of our contract with you, which includes providing you with charging services  
-  To take steps, at your request, before entering into a contract  
-  To comply with our legal and regulatory obligations  
-  For our legitimate interests (when we have a business or commercial reason to use your information, so long as this is not overridden by your own rights and interests) or those of a third party. For example, helping to resolve charging issues with a particular car manufacturer.  
-  Where you have given consent.  

We use your personal information for:

-  Providing you with the services you have requested from us (including vehicle authentication and charging session management), to process payments, to respond to any enquiries or complaints you may make to us and to manage our relationship with you. This is necessary for performing our contract with you, complying with our legal obligations and for our legitimate interests.  
-  Sending you our email newsletter, and other marketing communications with information you may find relevant or interesting – about new services, products, promotions, news and events (by email or in‑app / push notifications), including exclusive offers, promotions or new services and products. We will ask for your consent to send you promotional communications.  
-  We will always treat your personal information with the utmost respect and never sell it to other organisations for marketing purposes.  
-  You have the right to opt out of receiving promotional communications at any time by contacting us at support@evcps.uk or using the ‘unsubscribe’ link in emails.  
-  We may ask you to confirm or update your marketing preferences if you instruct us to provide further services and products in the future, or if there are changes in the law, regulation, or the structure of our business.  
-  We may use personal information for our legitimate interests to understand how customers use our services and to develop and grow our business. For example, we may run competitions, and this may involve processing the personal information of competition entrants. We may also use your data to run incentive programmes for use of our services. Specific details of these programmes will be provided before enrolment.  
-  There is also a business interest in understanding how you use our services and respond to different parts of our website and app so we can identify areas for improvement, understand how effective the locations of our chargers are, and understand the effectiveness of our website and app. To do this we may analyse the information about how you use our chargers, our website and app and our services.

## 4. Who we share your personal information with

We share personal information with:

-  Partners who provide space for our charging stations. However, any data they receive from us is anonymised or metadata which does not identify you directly.  
-  Third parties who help us to deliver our products and services to you. For example: payment service providers and charge point manufacturers.  
-  Other third parties we use to help us run our business. For example: marketing support or website hosts, or third parties approved by you, for example, third‑party payment providers.  

We only allow our service providers to handle your personal information if we are satisfied that they take appropriate measures to protect your personal information.

We may disclose and exchange information with law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations. For example, we may share information about suspected fraudulent activity on your account with the Police.  
We may also need to share some personal information with other parties, such as potential buyers of our business or during a restructuring. Usually, information will be anonymised but this may not always be possible. The recipient of the information will be bound by confidentiality obligations.

## 5. Where your personal information is held

Information may be held at our offices, third‑party agencies, service providers, and representatives as described above.

Some of these third parties may be based outside the European Economic Area. For more information, including on how we safeguard your personal information when this occurs, see below: ‘Transferring your personal information out of the EEA’.

## 6. How long your personal information will be kept

We will keep your personal information while you have an account with us, or whilst we are providing services to you. After this, we will keep your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary to respond to any questions, complaints or claims made by you or on your behalf, or to show that we have treated you fairly and/or to keep records required by law.

We won’t retain your personal information for longer than reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this policy including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. When it is no longer necessary to retain your personal information, we will delete or anonymise it.

## 7. Transferring your personal information out of the EEA

To deliver services to you, it is sometimes necessary for us to share your personal information outside the European Economic Area (EEA), with your and our service providers located outside the EEA, or if you are based outside the EEA, or where there is an international element to the services we are providing to you. In these cases, we only will transfer your data to contacts in countries approved by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection.
