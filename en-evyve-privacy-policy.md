In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.

**6\. MARKETING**

We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.

You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased services from us and you have not already opted out of marketing. This will be restricted to similar services and is necessary for our legitimate interests (to develop our products and services and grow our business).

**8\. THIRD-PARTY MARKETING**

We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any company outside of the **evyve** group of companies for marketing purposes and we will explicitly tell you who these companies are at the time.

**9\. OPTING OUT**

You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages via the app.

Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a product/service purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other transactions.

If you attend one of our events where photography and/or video is being captured please tell a member of staff as soon as possible on your arrival. If you attend one of our events with a child under the age of 16 then you are responsible for consideration and notification of their interests in this regard.

**10\. COOKIES**

You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly.

**11\. CHANGE OF PURPOSE**

We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please [contact us](https://evyve.co.uk/contact/).

If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

- Affiliates and subsidiaries of Evyve Services Limited
- External Third Parties including our service providers
- Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.

We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

Monta is our service provider for the **evyve** app. For more detail about how Monta will process your personal data, please see the Monta privacy policy which can be found here: <https://monta.com/en/legal-risk-compliance/privacy-policy/>

**13\. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS**

We do transfer your personal data to service providers that carry out certain functions on our behalf. This does involve transferring personal data outside the UK to countries within the European Economic Area, the USA, India and elsewhere globally as required for the provision of the services.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK, we ensure the transfer is done securely and lawfully by ensuring that the following safeguards are in place:

- Transferring your personal data to countries that have been deemed by the UK to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data; or
- We may use specific standard contractual terms approved for use in the UK which give the transferred personal data the same protection as it has in the UK, including the International Data Transfer Agreement and the International Data Transfer Addendum to the European Commission's standard contractual clauses for international data transfers. To obtain a copy of these contractual safeguards, please [contact us](https://evyve.co.uk/contact/).

**14\. DATA SECURITY**

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

**15\. DATA RETENTION**

**How long will you use my personal data for?**

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for at least six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see Request erasure below for further information.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

**16\. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS**

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data:

- Request access to your personal data.
- Request correction of your personal data.
- Request erasure of your personal data.

- Request restriction of processing your personal data.
- Request transfer of your personal data.
- Right to withdraw consent.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please [contact us](https://evyve.co.uk/contact/).

**No Fee Usually Required**

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

**What We May Need From You**

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

**Time Limit to Respond**

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

**17\. COMPLAINTS**

You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (<www.ico.org.uk>). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please [contact us](https://evyve.co.uk/contact/) in the first instance.

**18\. CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY NOTICE AND YOUR DUTY TO INFORM US OF CHANGES**
