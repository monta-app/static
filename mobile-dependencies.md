>       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
>       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

> 3. Responsibilities
> -------------------
> 
> 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
> 
> All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
> Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
> the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
> Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
> License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
> attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
> Form.
> 
> 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
> 
> If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
> 
> (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
>     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
>     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
>     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
>     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
> 
> (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
>     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
>     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
>     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
> 
> 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
> 
> You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
> provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
> the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
> Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
> Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
> License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
> under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
> the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
> Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
> License(s).
> 
> 3.4. Notices
> 
> You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
> (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
> or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
> the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
> the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
> 
> 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
> 
> You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
> indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
> Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
> behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
> such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
> You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
> liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
> indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
> disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
> jurisdiction.
> 
> 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
> ---------------------------------------------------
> 
> If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
> License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
> statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
> the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
> describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
> be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
> Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
> or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
> recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
> 
> 5. Termination
> --------------
> 
> 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
> if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
> compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
> Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
> Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
> ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
> non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
> come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
> Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
> notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
> first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
> from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
> Your receipt of the notice.
> 
> 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
> infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
> counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
> directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
> You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
> 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
> 
> 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
> end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
> have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
> prior to termination shall survive termination.

>           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
>           the Derivative Works; and
> 
>       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

>           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
>           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
>           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
>           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

>           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
>           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
>           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
>           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
>           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
>           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
>           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
>           as modifying the License.
> 
>       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
>       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
>       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
>       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
>       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
>       the conditions stated in this License.
> 
>    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
>       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

> 
>    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

> -------------------
> 
> 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
> 
> All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
> Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
> the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
> Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
> License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
> attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
> Form.
> 
> 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
> 
> If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
> 
> (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
>     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
>     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
>     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
>     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
> 
> (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
>     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
>     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
>     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
> 
> 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
> 
> You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
> provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
> the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
> Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
> Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
> License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
> under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
> the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
> Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
> License(s).
> 
> 3.4. Notices
> 
> You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
> (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
> or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
> the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
> the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
> 
> 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
> 
> You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
> indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
> Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
> behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
> such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
> You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
> liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
> indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
> disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
> jurisdiction.
> 
> 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
> ---------------------------------------------------
> 
> If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
> License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
> statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
> the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
> describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
> be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
> Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
> or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
> recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
> 
> 5. Termination
> --------------
> 
> 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
> if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
> compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
> Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
> Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
> ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
> non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
> come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
> Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
> notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
> first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
> from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
> Your receipt of the notice.
> 
> 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
> infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
> counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
> directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
> You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
> 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
> 
> 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
> end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
> have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
> prior to termination shall survive termination.
